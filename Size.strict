has iterator Iterator(Vector2)
has Width Number with value > 0
has Height Number with value > 0
for Iterator(Vector2)
	for x in Range(0, Width)
	for y in Range(0, Height)
		Vector2(x, y)
in(element Vector2) Boolean
	true
Length Number
	Width * Height
+(number) Size
	Size(1, 1) + 1 is Size(2, 2)
	Size(Width + number, Height + number)
*(number) Size
	Size(1, 1) * 5 is Size(5, 5)
	Size(Width * number, Height * number)
